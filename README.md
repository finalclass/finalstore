# FinalStore API

FinalStore is a RESTful API for typical online store.
It's still in development. Actually in the first stage which is writing documentation.
It will be written in [node.js](http://nodejs.org/).
For handling http it will use [express.js](http://expressjs.com/) framework.

FinalStore is an OpenSource project, 
distributed under **MIT** or **GPL** license (you can choose which license better suits your needs).

Please checkout the docs folder. Now all the work is on creating the interface.
